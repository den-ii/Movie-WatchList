## Overview
When I’m tired or down. I love to watch movies and tv series with friends, family and if the movie was really nice or funny which I hope it is then we talk and laugh about it. This Project is meant to about that a way to bring everyone together to talk about movies they love or didn’t love.
	Well that part is still in development,  this presentation is about the watchlist project . You can search for movies and tv shows and add them to your list so you never forget to watch
It was inspired by Scrimba where I learnt Javascript.
This Project uses Javascript and Omdb API. It wasn’t that easy building this project with only javascript, It would’ve been easier with React, but I got to solve problems. 
	Omdb API was used to get the movies or shows the user searches for. It would’ve been difficult to start keeping track of all the movies and shows ever produced.
	This Project would be making use of Typescript, React and Nodejs later on and I’m also thinking of changing the name.
I wondered how I could save the movies long term so I used localStorage but I’m going to use a database with authentication to make it available for the user on different devices.
I had a major challenge when removing a movie from the array, It did remove but it wasn’t rendering on the page.  I then solved it by refreshing the page to  render the modified array . This is one of the reasons React was formed
